		What does the program?
		______________________
The macro opens a .exe program. This generates a large number of patterns of fake tracking dots, based on the current system time and a random serial printer number.
A .png image with all the fake tracking dots in it is generated and imported in the document by the macro. When the document is printed by a Laser printer, Noone knows which pattern is the real and which 
is the fake pattern, so that your privatessphere is safe.


		How to install the program&macro
		________________________________
1. Download the .exe and the .odt file
2. Save the .exe file in any directory you want
3. open the .odt file and import the macro in it
4. In row 18 of the macro-code, paste in the filepath where you have saved the .exe program
5. you have now set up the macro.


		How to use the macro
		____________________

3. Before you print, start the macro. It will open the program.
4. Adjust the safety of your fake pattern.
5. if you want, you can set a time range to manipulate the time on the time stamps.
6. Click on "print"
7. Back in your document, click on the upper left corner of the document to select the image. 
8. set the image to Format>wrap-through so that your text can go behind the image.
9. Copy and paste the image onto each of your pages, if you have more than 1.
10. print the document


		Problems & Future
		_________________
As you see when you look in the code, the macro is only an example for how the idea could work.
We have problems with the macro, because we don't know how to how to e.g. set the image to activate wrapthrough by a macro.
For that reason, it would be great if somebody could improve our macro or the program. If you have questions or an improved version, please send us an email at errored@freenet.de
it would be very nice.
